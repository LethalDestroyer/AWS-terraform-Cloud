Subject: Submission of Assignment on AWS using Terraform instead of CloudFront

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about the successful completion and submission of the assignment based on AWS.

Instead of utilizing CloudFront as suggested, I opted to implement the solution using Terraform. I found Terraform to be more suitable for our requirements due to its flexibility and ease of management in provisioning AWS resources.

I am pleased to inform you that all tasks defined in the assignment have been successfully completed. The implementation meets the specified requirements and objectives.

For your review, I have shared the link to the Git repository containing the Terraform scripts and related documentation. You can access it [insert link to Git repository].

I kindly request you to review the assignment and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
